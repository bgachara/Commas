Earned Value - value of completed works.

Scheduled Performance Index - Earned value / Planned value. (Higher than 1 ratio means that much ahead of schedule)
Cost Performance Index - Earned value / Cost value. (Higher than 1 ratio means project under cost)

Rate Breakdown analysis - Materials/Amnt Equipment/Amt Manpower/Amt Subcontractor/Amt = Cost Rate.
